# VisualizingTolkienwithR

This is the repository for my open-source code for the Visualizing Tolkien project. Please acknowledge me when you use my code by citing this repository or the website. All conditions are listed in the Licence file in this repo.

Please also consider looking at the website for this project first: thefinalfrontier.wixsite.com/tolkienwithr. This website contains explanations of the coding choices and presents literary analysis of the code itself, which is a more complete view of /why/ this repo exists. Computational literary analysis does not exist in a vacuum with itself, so context and close reading are important steps to reading fiction computationally!

When using this code for your own projects, please fork the repo. 

Thank you, and have fun with computational literary analysis!
